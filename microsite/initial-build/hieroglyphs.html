          <h3>4th millennium BCE to 394 CE (last attested hieroglyphs at the island of philae)</h3>
              <p> In Egyptian culture, writing was considered a sacred activity that had the creative power to bring things into existence via writing. Their focus was on the ability to control the world by naming things around them. Hieroglyphs derived from the physical world the Egyptian people were surrounded byâ€”over 6,000 glyphs exist but only about 800 were commonly used.</p>

                  <p class="image_text"> One sign can stand for a single sound, a set of sounds (called phonograms) or a word (logograms). Sentences can be written left to right, right to left, or top to bottom, and are deciphered based on in which direction the sentence makes sense. There was also some variation over time, with certain writing directions being more popular during specific time periods.
