          <h2>Description</h2>
              <p>Food director Chris Morocco spent months (truly) developing this chocolate chip cookie recipe—he made nearly 30 batches, plus 10 more in the cross-testing phase—to ensure they were the absolute best. What makes this recipe deliver on that promise? Crispy edges, a buttery chew, and plenty of chocolate chunks in every bite—all without a stand mixer.</p>

          <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>   
              <p><u>Preheat oven to 375°</u> and place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven. Whisk <strong>all-purpose flour</strong>, <strong>kosher salt</strong>, and <strong>baking soda in a small bowl</strong>; set flour mixture aside.</p>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>   
              <p>Cook one stick of <strong>unsalted butter</strong> in a large saucepan over <u>medium heat</u>, swirling often and scraping bottom of pan with a heatproof rubber spatula, until butter foams, then browns, about <u>4 minutes</u>. Scrape melted butter and any brown bits to a large heatproof mixing bowl and let cool <u>1 minute</u>. Cut remaining ½ stick of <strong>unsalted butter</strong> into small pieces and add to brown butter (it should start to melt but not foam and sizzle, so test with one piece before adding the rest).</p>    
            <h3>Step 3</h3>   
              <p>Once butter is melted, add packed <strong>dark brown sugar</strong> and <strong>granulated sugar</strong> and whisk, breaking up any clumps, until sugar is incorporated and no lumps remain. Add <strong>1 large egg</strong> and <strong>2 large egg yolks</strong> and whisk until sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth, about <u>30 seconds</u>. Whisk in <strong>vanilla extract</strong>. Using rubber spatula, fold reserved dry ingredients into butter mixture just until no dry spots remain, then fold in <strong>bittersweet chocolate</strong> (the cookie dough will be soft but should hold its shape once scooped; if it slumps or oozes after being scooped, stir dough back together several times and <u> rest 5–10 minutes </u> until scoops hold their shape as the flour hydrates).</p>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>   
              <p>Using a 1½-oz. scoop (3 Tbsp.), portion out 16 balls of dough and divide between 2 parchment-paper-lined rimmed baking sheets. Bake cookies, rotating sheets if cookies are browning very unevenly (otherwise, just leave them alone), until deep golden brown and firm around the edges, <u>8–10 minutes.</u> Let cool on baking sheets.</p>
            <h3>Notes</h3>   
              <p>Dough balls can be portioned <u>3 months ahead</u>; freeze on cookie sheets and then transfer to a resealable plastic bag. Bake from frozen, adding <u>1–2 minutes</u> on to the cook time. Cookies can be baked <u>3 days</u> ahead. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.</p>

              <p>Good refrence becuase it includes images of the making process that aligns with the step in the making proccess as the viewer scrolls down the page. It is also good becuase the FAQ's are clearly stated at the end with a differenttype treatment to highlight their place and also limit users questions.</p>

             <p>Good refrence becuase it includes both links to special materials/tools found in the cooking process and answers common questions one may have after finishing regarding storage. It also bolds important things like the temperature to preheat so one can do so early and not skip over it or set the oven at the wrong number. Also the ingredients are bolded so its easer to read than their measurments or related info.</p>

             <p>On thing i like is that is has a spot that clearly states the prep time, cook time, total time, and yield. This can help the user quickly assess if the recipe will work prior to looking too close at the ingredients or making process. </p>
            <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com">NYT Cooking</a>
              <p>The site does a great job highlighting a recipe of the day to help frequent users always find something new. Also, it hierarchically highlights the recipe total time as an important piece of info as many users likley already know what they want to cook but don't want to cook for very long and therefore search the fastest recipe.</p>

                <p>I think this does a good job clearly and effectively communicates the differences between the different membership levels and benefits the cost includes. Additionally, the menu bar stays floating at the top of the page to help users easily selct a different option if they already selected an option.  </p>

              <a href="https://madebyshore.com/work">Made By Shore</a>
                <P>I think its really clever how the front page has not production work and instead is filled with their mission statement. Also, the scroll function on the meanu is responive to the mouse, though confusing, can allows the user to engage with the site in a more playful manner.</P>

              <a href="https://turnstyle.studio/overview">turnstyle</a>
                <P>I think the site does a good job communicating to a variety of clients as their title header is a gif that defines their studio in many ways. In this way, it implies both their flexibility and their workability with a variety of clientele. It's also very visually engaging.</P>
