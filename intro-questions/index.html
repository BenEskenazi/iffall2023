        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>1. My Name is Ben Eskenazi. I am a Junior ComDes student in the Sam Fox School</p>
        <p>2. I not only took this class because it is required for my major but because I am interested in UX/UI and the intersection between design and digital interfaces. 
            Most of my prior classes are in the print realm so I am interested to learn more about the digital design space. </p>
        <p>3. I have no prior experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</p>
        <p>4. In this class I am hoping to learn, to use, and be confident in, digital design. With no experience, I look forward to any growth and hope to enjoy this new section of design that I have not previously explored</p>
        <p>5. One thing I expect to be different from designing print media is the ability and necessity to scale depending on the screen size. This includes the smooth and seamless transitions between a vertical phone and horizontal computer.</p>
        <p>6. I think <a href="https://www.pentagram.com">Pentagram</a> has very effective design because the site is clearly organized and consistently laid out. It's not super complicated but everything has its spot.</p>
        <p>7. I think <a href="https://www.wearecollins.com">Collins</a> has very effective communication because the site responds to the users mouse hovers and clicks in a way that reveals some information while encourages the user to further explore.</p>
        <p>8. I think <a href="http://youtube.com">Youtube</a> works well as a website simply because the different actions that a user would want to use are generally in a clear spot that allows for more site searching on the users end and less time trying to understand how the site works. </p>
